All are fix-type changes addressing security/config logic (MIME types, __proto__ sanitization, deepMerge). All have XS/S size labels. Pattern suggests either: (1) related fixes to interconnected config/security subsystems that should be consolidated, or (2) rapid resubmissions/revisions of same logical change across multiple components. PR#16902 and PR#16924 both address __proto__ key rejection in merge operations, suggesting potential redundancy or partial supersession. Recommend review for consolidation/supersession relationship."

However, no strong evidence of duplicate/supersession: different domains (telegram inline buttons vs. plugin tools), different authors, different time windows (Feb 2 vs Feb 10). Probability of independent parallel contributions to distinct features is high. Low confidence cluster indicates weak duplicate signal; treating as independent PRs."
