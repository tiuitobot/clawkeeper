The core problem is simple \u2014 exec runs inside the container, but file tools run on the host. Agents find files at `/workspace/...` via exec, then read/write rejects those paths. The path remapping PRs (#11820, #14810, #9730) keep trying to translate between the two path spaces, but that's inherently fragile (traversal edge cases, prefix matching bugs, hardcoded workdir assumptions \u2014 each PR gets flagged for a different variant of the same issue).\r\n\r\nMy current workaround is mounting the container workspace at the exact same absolute path as the host (e.g. `/home/user/workspace/project:/home/user/workspace/project`) so both contexts see the same paths. It works, but it's ugly \u2014 you end up with unnecessarily long container paths that are just host path artifacts, and again it's just a workaround.\r\n\r\nThis PR just sidesteps all of that by running file I/O inside the container too. One execution context, no translation needed. The SandboxFsBridge abstraction is clean and the Greptile concerns from the initial review look addressed in the current diff.\r\n\r\nThere are still some related path issues around bundled skills, system prompt `<location>` tags, and other places where host paths leak into the sandbox context (#6346, #7915, etc). But I think getting alignment on this core approach first makes those follow-ups much more straightforward to tackle.\r\n\r\nThis would fix or largely address #9560, #9348, #2432.

These solve fundamentally different problems though \u2014 event sourcing captures the sequence of what happened (messages, tool calls, lifecycle events) with full replay capability. File sync keeps workspace files backed up across machines. They're complementary, not competing: you'd want event sourcing for audit trails and agent coordination, and file sync for portable workspace state. Both valid, different layers.

Invalid chimeIn.model parsing (fixed)**\nFixed in cc42279. The model ref is now validated for `provider/model` format before parsing. Invalid refs (no slash, trailing slash, provider-only like `\"openai\"`) fall back to the agent default model with a verbose log warning. Added 2 test cases covering both scenarios.\n\n**2. Blocked users still counted (not a bug)**\nThe users allowlist check at lines 475-489 runs unconditionally for all guild messages, **before** the chimeIn accumulation code at line 491+. If a user is not in the allowlist, they hit `return null` at line 486 and never reach the chimeIn counter. The allowlist check is not gated by `mentionGate.shouldSkip`.\n\n**3. ChimeIn uses stale history (not a bug)**\n`recordPendingHistoryEntryIfEnabled` calls `appendHistoryEntry` which synchronously pushes the entry into the Map via `history.push(entry)` + `historyMap.set(historyKey, history)`. When `evaluateChimeIn` reads `guildHistories.get(channelId)` on line 520, the current message is already included.", "createdAt": "2026-02-06T20:34:17Z", "includesCreatedEdit": false, "isMinimized": false, "minimizedReason": "", "reactionGroups": [], "url": "https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/10652#issuecomment-3862444925", "viewerDidAuthor": false}, {"id": "IC_kwDOQb6kR87nKN6a", "author": {"login": "BillChirico"}, "authorAssociation": "CONTRIBUTOR", "body": "This is awesome!", "createdAt": "2026-02-10T14:55:33Z", "includesCreatedEdit": false, "isMinimized": false, "minimizedReason": "", "reactionGroups": [{"content": "HEART", "users": {"totalCount": 1}}], "url": "https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/10652#issuecomment-3878215322", "viewerDidAuthor": false}, {"id": "IC_kwDOQb6kR87oYHUt", "author": {"login": "thewilloftheshadow"}, "authorAssociation": "MEMBER", "body": "This should be implemented differently as part of core, rather than just something stuck on Discord", "createdAt": "2026-02-13T18:17:47Z", "includesCreatedEdit": false, "isMinimized": false, "minimizedReason": "", "reactionGroups": [], "url": "https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/10652#issuecomment-3898635565", "viewerDidAuthor": false}], "reviews": [{"id": "PRR_kwDOQb6kR87gaOYc", "author": {"login": "greptile-apps"}, "authorAssociation": "CONTRIBUTOR", "body": "<sub>2 files reviewed, 3 comments</sub>\n\n<sub>[Edit Code Review Agent Settings](https://app.greptile.com/review/github) | [Greptile](https://greptile.com?utm_source=greptile_expert&utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=code_reviews)</sub>", "submittedAt": "2026-02-06T20:20:13Z", "includesCreatedEdit": false, "reactionGroups": [], "state": "COMMENTED", "commit": {"oid": ""}}], "files": [{"path": "src/config/types.discord.ts", "additions": 13, "deletions": 0}, {"path": "src/config/zod-schema.providers-core.ts", "additions": 11, "deletions": 0}, {"path": "src/discord/monitor/allow-list.ts", "additions": 15, "deletions": 0}, {"path": "src/discord/monitor/chime-in-eval.test.ts", "additions": 217, "deletions": 0}, {"path": "src/discord/monitor/chime-in-eval.ts", "additions": 93, "deletions": 0}, {"path": "src/discord/monitor/message-handler.preflight.ts", "additions": 64, "deletions": 14}, {"path": "src/discord/monitor/message-handler.preflight.types.ts", "additions": 1, "deletions": 0}, {"path": "src/discord/monitor/message-handler.ts", "additions": 3, "deletions": 0}]}

The env snapshot captured during read was trapped inside instance A and never reached instance B (write), so `restoreEnvVarRefs()` always fell back to live `process.env` \u2014 the exact TOCTOU issue the snapshot was meant to prevent.\n\nThe dominant server paths in `src/gateway/server-methods/config.ts` (`config.patch`, `config.apply`, `config.set`) all use these exported wrappers, not a shared IO instance.\n\n### The fix (`63583236d`)\n\n- Added a module-level `_moduleEnvSnapshot` that bridges the gap between wrapper calls\n- `readConfigFileSnapshot()` stores the snapshot via `io.getEnvSnapshot()`\n- `writeConfigFile()` injects it via `io.setEnvSnapshot()` before writing\n- Added `getEnvSnapshot()`/`setEnvSnapshot()` to the IO instance interface\n\n### Test proof\n\nNew file: `src/config/env-preserve-io.test.ts` (2 integration tests)\n\n1. **With snapshot bridging**: reads config with `MY_API_KEY=original-key-123`, mutates env to `mutated-key-456`, writes with bridged snapshot \u2192 file correctly contains `${MY_API_KEY}` \u2705\n2. **Without snapshot bridging** (old behavior): same scenario but no snapshot injection \u2192 restoration fails because live env no longer matches, resolved value written as-is \u2705\n\nAll 323 config tests pass (47 files).", "createdAt": "2026-02-08T03:13:19Z", "includesCreatedEdit": false, "isMinimized": false, "minimizedReason": "", "reactionGroups": [], "url": "https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/11560#issuecomment-3866026939", "viewerDidAuthor": false}, {"id": "IC_kwDOQb6kR87mbu3s", "author": {"login": "akoscz"}, "authorAssociation": "CONTRIBUTOR", "body": "@greptileai ok dude, review the PR once more\r\n", "createdAt": "2026-02-08T03:15:28Z", "includesCreatedEdit": false, "isMinimized": false, "minimizedReason": "", "reactionGroups": [{"content": "THUMBS_UP", "users": {"totalCount": 1}}], "url": "https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/11560#issuecomment-3866029548", "viewerDidAuthor": false}, {"id": "IC_kwDOQb6kR87mb6RB", "author": {"login": "akoscz"}, "authorAssociation": "CONTRIBUTOR", "body": "**Re: Cross-request env snapshot leak & Snapshot not path-scoped** \u2014 Valid point. Fixed in 627240d.\n\nThe module-level snapshot is now a `Map<configPath, snapshot>` instead of a single variable. `readConfigFileSnapshot()` stores keyed by resolved `configPath`, and `writeConfigFile()` only consumes the matching entry (deleted after use to prevent stale state). This prevents cross-config contamination if `OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH` changes between calls.\n\n**Re: Env var pattern mismatch (`hasEnvVarRef` missing `$${VAR}`)** \u2014 False positive. The regex `\\$\\{[A-Z_][A-Z0-9_]*\\}` matches the `${VAR}` substring inside `$${VAR}`, so `hasEnvVarRef(\"$${FOO}\")` returns `true`. The escape sequence correctly enters the resolution path.\n\n**Re: Incorrect escape restoration (backslash in template literal)** \u2014 False positive. The backtick expression uses `\\$` to prevent JavaScript from interpreting `${` as template interpolation. The runtime output is `${NAME}`, not `\\${NAME}`.

Fixed by normalising paths in the mock resolver with `path.resolve()`.\n\n2. **Array merge semantics** (Greptile comment): `deepMergeInto()` now concatenates arrays instead of overwriting, matching `deepMerge()` in `includes.ts`. This prevents array-valued keys from included files being incorrectly treated as local overrides.\n\n3. **Config.env resolution** (Greptile comment): `writeConfigFile()` now applies `config.env` entries to a local env copy before resolving `${VAR}` in included content, matching the read-path behaviour.

Previously, when `modelContextWindow` was present, the function returned it immediately \u2014 `contextTokens: 100k` on a 200k model did nothing. Now the function resolves the base window (model \u2192 modelsConfig) then applies `agentContextTokens` as an upper bound. This fixes the bug where `effectiveModel` was never capped.\n\n**Other fixes:**\n- Replaced hardcoded GitHub issue URL with short ref `#14143`\n- Renamed misleading test: 'caps model when equal' \u2192 'does not cap model when contextTokens equals model contextWindow'\n- Fixed modelsConfig test: now passes `modelContextWindow: undefined` to actually exercise the modelsConfig path (was masked by model metadata taking precedence)\n- Added new test: agentContextTokens caps modelsConfig when lower\n\nAll 20 tests pass (8 existing guard tests + 12 cap tests).", "createdAt": "2026-02-13T05:52:17Z", "includesCreatedEdit": false, "isMinimized": false, "minimizedReason": "", "reactionGroups": [], "url": "https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/15218#issuecomment-3895057403", "viewerDidAuthor": false}, {"id": "IC_kwDOQb6kR87oW4Ah", "author": {"login": "unisone"}, "authorAssociation": "CONTRIBUTOR", "body": "Closing \u2014 the core fix (agentContextTokens as a cap on model context window) was already landed on `main` in a cleaner implementation via `context-window-guard.ts`.
